# Lift-Simulation

Welcome to the Lift Simulation project! This web application allows you to simulate lift mechanics for your clients. It provides an interactive user interface where you can visualize lifts and buttons on different floors. By clicking on a specific button, you can command a lift to go to that floor.

## Project Details

### Requirements

To use the Lift Simulation web app, make sure you meet the following requirements:

1. Provide the number of floors and lifts as input.
2. Generate an interactive UI that visually represents the lifts and buttons on each floor.
3. Enable lift movement and floor selection through the user interface.

### Milestone 1

For the first milestone, we have accomplished the following:

- Implemented a data store to maintain the state of the application data.
- Developed a JavaScript engine that acts as the controller, determining which lift goes to which floor.
- Created a basic user interface that responds to the commands from the controller.

### Milestone 2

The second milestone includes the following features:

- Implemented a lift mechanism where the doors open in 2.5 seconds and close in another 2.5 seconds.
- Enabled lift movement at a rate of 2 seconds per floor.
- Configured the lifts to stop at every floor where they were called.
- Designed a mobile-friendly user interface to enhance accessibility.
